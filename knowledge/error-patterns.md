# Common Error Patterns by Level

Recurring mistakes English speakers make when learning Spanish, organized by CEFR level. Each entry includes the error, why it happens, and how to address it using Language Transfer teaching methods.

## A1 — Beginner Errors

**English pronunciation leaking in**
- Error: Pronouncing "s" as "z" (e.g., "visible" → "vi-zi-ble")
- Why: English s between vowels often becomes z
- Address: "Make sure that s stays crisp. S, not z. Visible."

**Vowel inconsistency**
- Error: Pronouncing Spanish vowels like English (e.g., "generación" → "genaración")
- Why: English vowels shift depending on stress; Spanish vowels don't
- Address: "Take it syllable by syllable. Each vowel is pronounced exactly as written."

**Aspirating the silent h**
- Error: "Hospital" with a slight h sound
- Why: English h is always pronounced
- Address: "Imagine the word starts with 'o'. No h exists. Ospital in your mind."

## A2 — Elementary Errors

**Confusing verb types (-ar/-er/-ir)**
- Error: Applying -ar endings to -er verbs or vice versa
- Why: Not checking verb type before conjugating
- Address: "Before you change any verb, quick check — what type is it? -ar, -er, or -ir?"

**Object pronoun placement**
- Error: "Quiero lo cancelar" instead of "quiero cancelarlo" or "lo quiero cancelar"
- Why: English word order (want it cancel)
- Address: "Pronouns either attach to the infinitive or go before the conjugated verb. Pick one."

**Over-translating prepositions**
- Error: "Sueño sobre ella" (dream about her) instead of "sueño con ella" (dream with her)
- Why: Direct translation of English prepositions
- Address: "In Spanish you don't dream 'about' someone. You dream 'with' them. Sueño con ella."

## B1 — Intermediate Errors

**Preterite/Imperfect confusion**
- Error: Using preterite for background descriptions ("Fue un día bonito cuando llegué")
- Why: English uses simple past for both functions
- Address: "Think: is this action the backdrop or the event? The backdrop uses imperfect. 'Era un día bonito cuando llegué.'"

**Ser/Estar mix-ups with adjectives**
- Error: "Es cansado" (he is a tiring person) instead of "Está cansado" (he is tired)
- Why: English has one "to be"
- Address: "Ask yourself: is this about what something IS (ser) or how something FEELS right now (estar)?"

**Forgetting stem changes**
- Error: "Yo dormo" instead of "Yo duermo"
- Why: Applying regular rules to stem-changing verbs
- Address: "Some verbs split their vowel when you stress it. Dormir → duermo. Soñar → sueño."

---

## B2 — Upper Intermediate Errors

**Avoiding subjunctive**
- Error: "Quiero que vienes" instead of "Quiero que vengas"
- Why: Subjunctive doesn't exist in modern English; students default to indicative
- Address: "After 'quiero que,' the action isn't real yet — you WANT it to happen. That 'unrealness' is exactly what subjunctive expresses."

**Conditional in si-clauses**
- Error: "Si tendría..." instead of "Si tuviera..."
- Why: English uses "would" in both halves; Spanish never uses conditional after "si"
- Address: "In Spanish, 'si' NEVER gets conditional. The formula is: si + past subjunctive... conditional. Si tuviera... haría."

**Overusing "muy"**
- Error: "Muy muy bueno" instead of richer intensifiers
- Why: "Very" is the go-to English intensifier
- Address: "Try 'bastante,' 'realmente,' 'increíblemente,' 'sumamente' — they give your Spanish more texture."

## C1 — Advanced Errors

**Register mismatch**
- Error: Using "tú" with someone who expects "usted" (or vice versa in voseo regions)
- Why: Register intuition comes from immersion, not study
- Address: "When in doubt, start with usted. The other person will usually signal 'tutéame' if they prefer tú."

**False friend traps**
- Error: "Estoy embarazada" meaning "I'm embarrassed" (it means "I'm pregnant")
- Why: Direct cognate assumption
- Address: "Not every cognate translates directly. 'Embarrassed' is 'avergonzado/a.' 'Embarazada' is pregnant. Classic trap."

**Subjunctive in relative clauses**
- Error: "Busco a alguien que sabe" instead of "Busco a alguien que sepa"
- Why: The indicative/subjunctive distinction in relative clauses is subtle
- Address: "'Alguien que sabe' = I have a specific person in mind. 'Alguien que sepa' = I'm looking for ANY person with this quality. Which is it?"

## C2 — Near-Native Polish

**Unnatural word order**
- Error: Always using SVO order instead of fronting for emphasis
- Why: English has fixed word order; Spanish is flexible
- Address: "Spanish lets you move things around for emphasis. 'A mí me parece que...' hits differently than 'Me parece que...'"

**Missing diminutive/augmentative nuance**
- Error: Not using -ito/-ita, -ón/-ota for tone
- Why: English doesn't have productive diminutive suffixes
- Address: "There's a whole emotional layer in 'un momentito' vs 'un momento.' The diminutive softens, warms, pleads."

**Overly literal idioms**
- Error: Translating English idioms instead of using Spanish ones
- Why: Idioms are the last frontier
- Address: "Instead of 'llover gatos y perros,' try 'llover a cántaros.' Every language has its own images."
