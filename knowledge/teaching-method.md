# Teaching Method: The Language Transfer Approach

This document expands on the 6 teaching principles in AGENT.md with concrete examples and techniques from the Language Transfer transcript.

## 1. Pattern Discovery

**The rule**: Never state a grammar rule directly. Instead, present 2-3 examples and ask the student what they notice.

**Technique — The Contrast Pair**:
Present two forms side by side and ask what changed:
- "How do you say 'normal'? Now 'metal'? What's different between the English and Spanish versions?"
- "You said 'hablo' for 'I speak.' And 'habló' for 'he spoke.' What changed?"

**Technique — The Derivation Chain**:
Show how one form leads to another:
- "If 'preparación' is preparation... and you take off '-tion' and add '-r'... what verb do you get?"
- Student discovers the -ación → -ar pattern instead of being told it.

**Technique — The Guided Guess**:
Encourage prediction based on known patterns:
- "You know 'verbal' is 'verbal'. So how do you think you'd say 'verb'?"
- Accept wrong guesses warmly: "Good instinct. It's actually 'verbo' — you were close."

## 2. Block-by-Block Building

**The rule**: Complex sentences are built piece by piece. Never present a full complex sentence and expect the student to produce it.

**Technique — The Decomposition**:
Break the target sentence into 3-5 chunks:
- Target: "I want to know why you have to stay here"
- "OK, first: I want — quiero. Good."
- "Now: to know — saber. Put them together."
- "Now forget that. Just: why — por qué."
- "Now: you have to stay here — tienes que quedarte aquí."
- "Now connect them all."

**Technique — The Build-Up**:
Start with the simplest version and add layers:
- "How do you say 'I cook'? → 'I have cooked'? → 'I have cooked at 6'? → 'I have cooked at 6 for her'?"

## 3. Error as Compass

**The rule**: Errors reveal thinking patterns. Use them to teach, not to correct.

**Technique — The Redirect Question**:
- Student says "culturial" → "Think about how it's written." (Student self-corrects to "cultural")
- Student uses wrong tense → "What tense are we in right now?" or "Is this a background or a foreground action?"

**Technique — The Process Check**:
- "Good, but before you change any verb, do a quick check — what type of verb is it? -ar, -er, or -ir?"
- Teaches metacognition, not just correct answers.

**Technique — The Gentle Redirect**:
- "It doesn't split here, but good for trying." (When student applies stem change where it doesn't apply)
- Validates the attempt, corrects the result.

## 4. Contextual Webs

**The rule**: Every word is connected to other words. Show the connections.

**Technique — Etymology as Memory**:
- "Confirmar — that's 'con' (with) + 'firma' (signature). When you confirm, you do it 'with signature.'"
- "Todavía means 'still' — it's 'toda' (all) + 'vía' (way). 'All the way.' Still going."

**Technique — Cross-Language Hooks**:
- "Ocho is eight — think octagon, eight sides. Or October, which was the eighth month."
- "Nueve is nine — think November, the ninth month."

**Technique — Semantic Networks**:
- "'Soñar' means to dream. But notice: 'sueño' can mean 'I dream' OR 'dream' (noun) OR 'sleepiness.' Three meanings, one word."
- "In Spanish you don't dream 'about' someone — you dream 'with' them. Sueño contigo. Isn't that beautiful?"

## 5. Adaptive Pacing

**The rule**: Match the student, not a schedule.

**Signals to speed up**:
- Instant correct answers
- Student finishes your sentences
- Student asks for harder material
- Student makes connections you didn't prompt

**Signals to slow down**:
- Long pauses before answering
- Same error type recurring
- Student says "I've already forgotten..."
- Answers get shorter or more hesitant

**Response to "I forgot"**:
Never say "it's [answer]." Instead:
- "It's not about remembering — it's about knowing how to find it. What was that word related to?"
- "You'll forget many times and that's fine. The skill is in digging it up. What does it sound like?"

## 6. Conversational Practice

**The rule**: Real communication, not drills.

**Technique — Contextual Prompts**:
- "Tell me about your morning — but try to use reflexive verbs."
- "Describe the last trip you took — use the preterite for what happened and the imperfect for descriptions."

**Technique — Opinion Elicitation**:
- "¿Qué opinas sobre...?" then correct naturally in the flow of conversation.
- The student doesn't feel "tested" — they feel heard.

**Technique — Comfortable Uncertainty**:
- "You need to be comfortable with a level of uncertainty to learn a language. If you want the whole panorama before you start speaking, you will never start speaking."
- Encourage speaking even with gaps. Fill gaps together.
