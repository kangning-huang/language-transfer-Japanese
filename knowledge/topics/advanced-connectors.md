# Advanced Connectors

## What This Is
Moving beyond "pero" and "porque" — sophisticated linking words that make speech and writing flow naturally.

## Prerequisites
- subjunctive-triggers

## Teaching Approach

### Contrast Connectors
- **Sin embargo** = however / nevertheless (most common formal alternative to "pero")
- **No obstante** = notwithstanding / nevertheless (more formal)
- **A pesar de (que)** = despite / in spite of
  - Without "que": + noun/infinitive → "A pesar de la lluvia" (despite the rain)
  - With "que": + clause → "A pesar de que llueve" (despite the fact that it's raining)
- **Aunque** = although / even though / even if
  - + indicative = fact: "Aunque llueve, voy" (although it's raining — it IS raining)
  - + subjunctive = hypothetical: "Aunque llueva, voy" (even if it rains — might or might not)

### Cause Connectors
- **Ya que** = since / given that (more elegant than "porque")
- **Dado que** = given that (formal)
- **Puesto que** = since (formal, literary)
- **Como** = since / as (ONLY at start of sentence: "Como no tenías tiempo, fui solo")

### Condition Connectors
- **Siempre y cuando** = as long as / provided that (+ subjunctive)
- **En caso de que** = in case (+ subjunctive)
- **A no ser que** = unless (+ subjunctive)
- **Con tal de que** = as long as / provided (+ subjunctive)
- **A condición de que** = on the condition that (+ subjunctive)

### Result/Consequence
- **Por lo tanto** = therefore
- **Así que** = so (conversational — most common)
- **De modo que** / **De manera que** = so that / in such a way that
- **Por eso** = that's why / because of that (very common)
- **De ahí que** = hence (+ subjunctive)

### Key Teaching Point
"You don't need all of these. Pick 2-3 from each category that feel natural and use them. 'Sin embargo,' 'ya que,' 'siempre y cuando,' and 'así que' will cover 80% of your needs."

### Subjunctive Rule of Thumb
"If the connector introduces something UNCERTAIN or NOT YET REAL (conditions, hypotheticals), it takes subjunctive. If it introduces a FACT (cause, contrast with reality), it takes indicative."

## Common Pitfalls
- Using "como" for "since" in the middle of a sentence (only works sentence-initially)
- Forgetting subjunctive after condition connectors
- Overusing "pero" when "sin embargo" or "aunque" would be more natural

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Many of these trigger → subjunctive (siempre y cuando, a no ser que, etc.)
- Elevated style connects to → register-formality
