# Cognate Patterns

## What This Is
Rules for converting English words to Spanish using Latin-root patterns. This gives the student thousands of words instantly.

## Prerequisites
None — this is entry point material.

## Teaching Approach

Start with the simplest rule (-al stays the same) and build up. Let the student discover each pattern through examples, never state the rule first.

### Rule 1: -al words
- Present: "normal in Spanish is... normal. But where's the stress?"
- Student notices: stress shifts to the end (norMAL)
- Practice: metal, legal, liberal, natural, cultural, total, verbal, fatal, colonial
- Gotcha: make sure they pronounce vowels as written ("natural" not "natchural")

### Rule 2: -ant/-ent → -ante/-ente
- Present: "important becomes importante. Where's the stress?"
- Practice: diferente, constante, urgente, conveniente
- Bonus: add -mente for adverbs (constantemente, legalmente, normalmente)

### Rule 3: -tion → -ción
- Present: "opinion → opinión. Now preparation?"
- Student discovers: -tion becomes -ción with accent on end
- Practice: confirmación, conversación, organización, complicación
- **Key derivation**: -ación words → remove -tion, add -r → verb (preparación → preparar)
- This unlocks ~1,000 verbs

### Rule 4: -ible/-able stays similar
- Present: "possible → posible. Probable → probable."
- Stress shifts to second-to-last syllable
- Practice: flexible, visible, terrible, horrible

### Rule 5: -ence/-ance → -encia/-ancia
- Present: "experience → experiencia. Difference?"
- Practice: influencia, existencia, consistencia, incongruencia

### Sound changes to teach
- /j/ sound → /kh/ (general → general with throat friction)
- Silent h (hospital, habitual, horrible)
- s never becomes z

## Common Pitfalls
- English vowel sounds leaking in (pronouncing "generación" with English vowels)
- Trying to apply cognate rules to Germanic words (won't work with "big", "small", etc.)
- Pronouncing s as z between vowels

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Leads directly into → quiero-basics (using derived verbs in sentences)
- Leads directly into → pronunciation (vowel rules reinforced here)
- The -ación → -ar derivation is one of the most powerful tools in the course
