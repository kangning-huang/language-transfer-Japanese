# Conditional + Subjunctive Combinations

## What This Is
Hypothetical "if... then..." chains at every level of complexity. The peak of Spanish grammar.

## Prerequisites
- subjunctive-imperfect
- future-conditional

## Teaching Approach

### Three Levels of Hypotheticals

**Level 1: Possible (present/future)**
- Si + present indicative → present/future
- "Si llueve, no voy." (If it rains, I'm not going.)
- "Si tienes tiempo, ven." (If you have time, come.)
- No subjunctive needed — this is possible/real.

**Level 2: Unlikely/Contrary to fact (present)**
- Si + imperfect subjunctive → conditional
- "Si tuviera dinero, viajaría." (If I had money, I would travel — but I don't.)
- "Si fuera tú, no lo haría." (If I were you, I wouldn't do it.)
- The "-ra... -ría" rhythm is the heartbeat of this structure.

**Level 3: Impossible (past — it didn't happen)**
- Si + pluperfect subjunctive → conditional perfect
- "Si hubiera sabido, habría ido." (If I had known, I would have gone — but I didn't know.)
- "Si hubieras llamado, te habría ayudado." (If you had called, I would have helped you.)

### The Golden Rule
**Si NEVER gets conditional.** Ever. In any hypothetical.
- ✅ Si tuviera... haría
- ❌ Si tendría... haría
- ✅ Si hubiera sabido... habría ido
- ❌ Si habría sabido...

### Mixing Levels
Real conversations mix time frames:
- "Si hubiera estudiado más (past — didn't happen), ahora tendría un mejor trabajo (present result)."
- "Si no fuera por ti (present contrary), nunca habría empezado (past result)."

### Practice Through Natural Scenarios
- "What would you do if you won the lottery?" → Si ganara la lotería...
- "What would you have done differently in school?" → Si hubiera podido...
- "If you could live anywhere, where?" → Si pudiera vivir en cualquier lugar...

### Key Teaching Point
"Don't memorize the formulas. Feel the logic: the more impossible or distant the scenario, the more 'layered' the grammar becomes. Si tuviera (one layer back). Si hubiera tenido (two layers back)."

## Common Pitfalls
- Conditional after si (the #1 error at this level)
- Mixing up "hubiera" (past subjunctive of haber) with "habría" (conditional of haber)
- Over-complicating: sometimes Level 1 (si + present) is all you need

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Combines → future-conditional + subjunctive-imperfect + compound-tenses
- This is the culmination of the tense system
