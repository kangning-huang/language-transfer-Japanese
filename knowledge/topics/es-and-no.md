# Es and No

## What This Is
First sentence construction: "es" (is) and "no es" (is not). The foundation for all sentences.

## Prerequisites
None.

## Teaching Approach

Start making sentences immediately using cognate vocabulary. The student should feel like a Spanish speaker within 5 minutes.

### Core Vocabulary
- **es** = is / he is / she is / it is / you are (formal)
- **no** = not / no / don't (same word for all)
- **no es** = is not / it isn't

### Building First Sentences
Use cognates the student already knows:
- "How would you say 'it is normal'?" → Es normal.
- "It is legal?" → Es legal.
- "It's not ideal?" → No es ideal.
- "It's important?" → Es importante.

### Key Teaching Points
- No need for "it" — "es" already contains the subject
- "No" goes before the verb — same as English "is not" → "no es"
- Start with statements, then show that questions are identical but with rising intonation

### Practice Sentences
Build complexity gradually:
1. Es normal. / No es normal.
2. Es importante. / No es importante.
3. Normalmente es importante. (introduces adverbs naturally)
4. Naturalmente es original. (stringing ideas together)

## Common Pitfalls
- Trying to add subject pronouns unnecessarily ("it es normal")
- Using English word order for negation ("es no legal")

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Leads into → quiero-basics (from single-verb sentences to verb + infinitive)
- Leads into → ser-vs-estar (es is from ser — distinction comes later)
