# The Gustar Pattern

## What This Is
Verbs that work "backwards" — the thing pleases you, rather than you liking the thing.

## Prerequisites
- pronouns-object

## Teaching Approach

### The Inversion Insight
Don't say "gustar is irregular." Show the logic:
- "In Spanish, you don't say 'I like music.' You say 'music pleases me.' The music is doing the action."
- Me gusta la música = music pleases me = I like music
- Me gustan los libros = books please me = I like books

### Building It Up
- Me gusta → I like (singular thing)
- Me gustan → I like (plural things)
- Te gusta → you like
- Le gusta → he/she likes
- Nos gusta → we like
- Les gusta → they like

### Clarification with "a"
Since "le gusta" could mean he/she/you(formal), clarify with "a":
- A ella le gusta = SHE likes
- A Juan le gusta = Juan likes
- A mí me gusta = I like (emphatic)
- A ti te gusta = YOU like (emphatic)

### Other Verbs That Work Like Gustar
- **Interesar**: Me interesa la historia (I'm interested in history)
- **Importar**: No me importa (I don't care / it doesn't matter to me)
- **Encantar**: Me encanta cocinar (I love cooking — literally "cooking enchants me")
- **Molestar**: Me molesta el ruido (the noise bothers me)
- **Parecer**: Me parece bien (it seems good to me)
- **Faltar**: Me falta tiempo (I'm lacking time / time is missing to me)

### Key Teaching Point
"This pattern isn't weird — English does it too sometimes. 'It bothers me.' 'It interests me.' Spanish just does it more often."

## Common Pitfalls
- "Yo gusto" (I like — wrong, this means "I am pleasing")
- Forgetting to match gusta/gustan to the THING, not the person
- Not using "a mí" / "a ti" for emphasis

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Deepens understanding of → pronouns-object
- Same inverted logic appears in → some reflexive constructions
