# Imperfect (Background Past)

## What This Is
The "video" past tense — ongoing, habitual, or background actions. "I was speaking," "she used to buy," "it was raining."

## Prerequisites
- present-regular

## Teaching Approach

### Frame It Through Feeling
"The imperfect is gentle. It's the background music of a story, not the events. It's what WAS HAPPENING when something else occurred."

### The Beauty: Only 3 Irregulars
This tense is incredibly regular. Only THREE verbs are irregular:
- **Ir**: iba, ibas, iba, íbamos, iban (I was going / I used to go)
- **Ser**: era, eras, era, éramos, eran (I was / I used to be)
- **Ver**: veía, veías, veía, veíamos, veían (I was watching / I used to see)

Everything else follows the pattern perfectly.

### -AR Verbs (-aba)
- Hablaba, hablabas, hablaba, hablábamos, hablaban
- "Listen to that -aba. It's soft, flowing, ongoing — it sounds like what it means."

### -ER/-IR Verbs (-ía)
- Comía, comías, comía, comíamos, comían
- Vivía, vivías, vivía, vivíamos, vivían
- "Notice: yo and él/ella are the same (comía). Context tells you who."

### What Imperfect Expresses
1. **Habitual past**: "When I was young, I used to play" → Cuando era joven, jugaba
2. **Background/description**: "It was a beautiful day" → Era un día bonito
3. **Ongoing action**: "I was cooking when she arrived" → Cocinaba cuando ella llegó
4. **Age/time in past**: "I was 10 years old" → Tenía diez años / "It was 3 o'clock" → Eran las tres
5. **States of mind/feelings**: "I wanted to go" (ongoing desire) → Quería ir

### Key Teaching Point
"If you can add 'used to' or 'was ___ing' to the English, it's probably imperfect."

## Common Pitfalls
- Using preterite for descriptions ("fue un día bonito" — wrong for background)
- Forgetting that yo and él/ella share the same form in -er/-ir imperfect
- Overthinking it — imperfect is actually the easier tense

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Essential for → preterite-vs-imperfect (the big intermediate challenge)
- Same -ía ending used in → future-conditional (conditional tense)
- Background for → subjunctive-imperfect (-ra forms)
