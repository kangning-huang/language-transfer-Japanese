# Preterite (Point-in-Time Past)

## What This Is
The "snapshot" past tense — completed actions at a specific point in time. "I spoke," "she bought," "they arrived."

## Prerequisites
- present-regular

## Teaching Approach

### Introduction Through Stress Discovery
The transcript beautifully introduces this through contrasting stress:
- "Hablo" (I speak) vs "Habló" (he spoke) — same letters, different stress!
- "What did I change to get from 'I speak' to 'he spoke'?" → Student notices the accent shift.

### -AR Verb Pattern (hablar as model)
- Yo hablé (I spoke) — accent on é
- Él/Ella habló (he/she spoke) — accent on ó
- Nosotros hablamos (we spoke) — same as present! context tells you
- Ellos hablaron (they spoke)
- Tú hablaste (you spoke)

Key: "The accent is PUSHING into the past — it moves to the end."

Practice through sentences, not tables:
- "How would you say 'I bought'?" → Compré
- "I bought it" → Lo compré
- "He bought it for me" → Me lo compró
- "I sent it to you" → Te lo envié

### -ER/-IR Verb Pattern (comer as model)
- Yo comí
- Él/Ella comió
- Nosotros comimos
- Ellos comieron
- Tú comiste

### Common Irregulars
The "messy" ones — but some patterns exist:
- **Ir/Ser**: fui, fue, fuimos, fueron (ir and ser are identical in preterite!)
- **Estar**: estuve, estuvo, estuvimos, estuvieron
- **Tener**: tuve, tuvo, tuvimos, tuvieron
- **Hacer**: hice, hizo, hicimos, hicieron
- **Decir**: dije, dijo, dijimos, dijeron

### Key Teaching Point
"The preterite is for completed actions. Things that started AND finished. It's a point on a timeline, not a stretch."

### Time Markers That Signal Preterite
Ayer (yesterday), la semana pasada, el año pasado, una vez (once), de repente (suddenly)

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing stress: haBLO (present) vs haBLÓ (past) — critical distinction
- "Nosotros" form identical in present and preterite for -ar verbs (context resolves it)
- Memorizing irregular forms as isolated facts instead of using them in sentences

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Must be learned before → preterite-vs-imperfect
- Contrasts with → past-imperfect
- Leads to → present-perfect (an alternative past construction)
