# Present Tense — Irregular Verbs

## What This Is
Stem-changing verbs and common irregulars that don't follow regular patterns.

## Prerequisites
- present-regular

## Teaching Approach

### Stem Changes — Discovery Through Pairs
Don't announce "stem-changing verbs exist." Let the student discover them:

**O → UE pattern**:
- "How is 'to sleep'? Dormir. Now 'I sleep'?"  
- Student might say "dormo" → "What if the o splits open when you stress it?"
- Student: "Duermo?" → "Yes! Duermo. But 'we sleep'?"
- Student: "Dormimos" → "See? When we DON'T stress the o, it stays normal."
- More verbs: poder→puedo, volver→vuelvo, encontrar→encuentro

**E → IE pattern**:
- Querer→quiero (they already know this!), pensar→pienso, entender→entiendo
- "You already use this pattern — quiero. The e splits to ie when stressed."

**E → I pattern** (only -ir verbs):
- Pedir→pido, servir→sirvo, seguir→sigo

### Common Irregulars — Yo Form
Many verbs are only irregular in the "yo" form:
- Tener → tengo (but tienes, tiene, tenemos, tienen are predictable)
- Hacer → hago
- Poner → pongo
- Salir → salgo
- Venir → vengo
- Decir → digo
- Saber → sé
- Conocer → conozco

### Key Teaching Points
- Stem changes only happen when the stem vowel is STRESSED (yo, tú, él, ellos — not nosotros)
- Most irregularity is in the yo form — the rest follows patterns
- Don't try to memorize — notice, use, and they'll stick

## Common Pitfalls
- Applying stem change to nosotros ("duermimos" — wrong, it's dormimos)
- Over-regularizing ("yo teno" instead of "tengo")
- Trying to remember all irregulars at once instead of learning through use

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Stem changes reappear in → subjunctive-present
- Irregular yo forms help predict → past-preterite irregular stems
