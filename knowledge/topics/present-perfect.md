# Present Perfect

## What This Is
"I have spoken," "she has eaten" — haber + past participle. Used more broadly in Spanish than English.

## Prerequisites
- past-preterite

## Teaching Approach

### Building from Haber
Students already know haber from other contexts. The present perfect uses its present forms:
- He (I have), has (you have), ha (he/she has), hemos (we have), han (they have)
- + past participle (-ado for -ar verbs, -ido for -er/-ir verbs)

### Discovery
- "How do you say 'I have cooked'?" → He cocinado
- "We have cooked at 8?" → Hemos cocinado a las ocho
- "She has spoken?" → Ha hablado

### Past Participle Formation
- -ar → -ado (hablar → hablado, cocinar → cocinado)
- -er/-ir → -ido (comer → comido, vivir → vivido)
- Irregulars: dicho (said), hecho (done/made), escrito (written), visto (seen), puesto (put), vuelto (returned), abierto (opened), roto (broken)

### Spanish vs. English Usage
"In Spanish, you can use the present perfect more than in English. 'He cocinado a las seis' (I have cooked at 6) is perfectly natural in Spanish, even though in English we'd say 'I cooked at 6.'"

### Regional Variation
- Spain: prefers present perfect for recent past ("Hoy he comido paella")
- Latin America: prefers preterite for the same ("Hoy comí paella")
- Both are correct, just regional preference

## Common Pitfalls
- Separating haber from participle ("He no cocinado" — wrong; "No he cocinado")
- Confusing he (I have) with the pronoun "él" (he)
- Using wrong participle form (making up irregulars or forgetting real ones)

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Haber forms also used in → compound-tenses (pluperfect, future perfect, conditional perfect)
- Participles used as adjectives (la puerta está abierta)
