# Present Tense — Regular Verbs

## What This Is
Conjugating -ar, -er, -ir verbs in the present tense. The engine of everyday speech.

## Prerequisites
- quiero-basics (understands infinitive form and basic verb concept)

## Teaching Approach

### Discover Through Pattern, Not Tables
Don't present a conjugation table. Build it through discovery:

**Start with one verb they know** (e.g., hablar, to speak):
- "Quiero means I want. That -o ending is 'I.' So 'I speak' from hablar would be...?"
- Student: "Hablo."
- "And if -o is I, what do you think -a might be for he/she speaks?"
- Student: "Habla."

**Build the pattern through questions**:
- Yo → -o (hablo)
- Él/Ella/Usted → -a (habla)
- Tú → -as (hablas) — "just add an s for informal you"
- Nosotros → -amos (hablamos)
- Ellos/Ustedes → -an (hablan) — "add an n for they/you guys"

### The -er/-ir Pattern
- Show it follows the same logic but with different vowels
- -ar uses a: habla, hablas, hablamos, hablan
- -er/-ir uses e: come, comes, comemos, comen
- The -o for "I" is universal

### Key Teaching Points
- Present tense = both "I speak" AND "I am speaking" (no separate continuous form needed for now)
- Subject pronouns are optional — the ending tells you who
- Use pronouns only for emphasis or clarification

### Practice Through Sentences, Not Drills
- "How do you say 'she cooks'?" → Cocina.
- "You cook (informal)?" → Cocinas.
- "We cook?" → Cocinamos.
- "Can you cook something for me?" → ¿Puedes cocinarme algo?

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to check verb type (-ar vs -er vs -ir) before conjugating
- Using subject pronouns every time (sounds unnatural in Spanish)
- Confusing haBLO (I speak, present) with haBLÓ (he spoke, past) — stress matters

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Foundation for → present-irregular (stem changes and irregulars)
- Foundation for → all other tenses (same person system, different endings)
- Combines with → pronouns-object for complex sentences
