# Preterite vs. Imperfect

## What This Is
THE intermediate hurdle. When to use each past tense in context.

## Prerequisites
- past-preterite
- past-imperfect

## Teaching Approach

### The Metaphor: Movie vs. Snapshot
"Imperfect is the camera panning across a scene — setting, background, what was already happening. Preterite is the flash of the camera — a specific moment captured."

### The Interruption Pattern
This is the clearest way to feel the difference:
- "I was cooking (imperfect — ongoing) when she arrived (preterite — interruption)"
- Cocinaba cuando ella llegó.
- "It was raining (imperfect) when we left (preterite)"
- Llovía cuando salimos.

The imperfect is the backdrop. The preterite is the event.

### Side-by-Side Contrast
Same verb, different meaning based on tense:

| Imperfect | Preterite |
|-----------|-----------|
| Sabía (I knew — state) | Supe (I found out — moment of discovery) |
| Conocía (I knew him — ongoing acquaintance) | Conocí (I met him — first encounter) |
| Quería (I wanted — ongoing desire) | Quise (I tried to / wanted and acted) |
| No quería (I didn't want — state) | No quise (I refused — active decision) |
| Podía (I was able to — ability existed) | Pude (I managed to — succeeded) |

"See how the preterite turns states into events? 'Saber' in preterite isn't 'I knew' — it's 'I found out.' The moment of CHANGE."

### Narrative Practice
Tell a story together, marking each verb:
- "Era un día normal [imperfect — setting]. Hacía sol [imperfect — description]. Yo caminaba por la calle [imperfect — ongoing action] cuando de repente vi [preterite — sudden event] a un viejo amigo."

### The Decision Framework
Ask yourself:
1. Is this action **completed** at a specific point? → Preterite
2. Is this **background**, description, or habitual? → Imperfect
3. Is this a **state of being** (weather, age, time, emotion)? → Usually imperfect
4. Did this action **interrupt** something else? → Preterite for the interruption, imperfect for what was interrupted

## Common Pitfalls
- Using preterite for everything (English doesn't make this distinction, so students default to preterite)
- Using imperfect for sequences of completed actions ("comía y después salía" — should be "comí y después salí")
- Overthinking: sometimes both are technically correct, just with different nuance

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Foundation for → compound-tenses (pluperfect adds another past layer)
- The imperfect's -ía connects to → future-conditional
