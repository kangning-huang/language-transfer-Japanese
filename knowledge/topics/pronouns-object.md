# Object Pronouns

## What This Is
Me, te, lo, la, nos, los, las — how to say "it," "him," "her," "them," and handle indirect objects.

## Prerequisites
- present-regular

## Teaching Approach

### Start From What They Know
Students already use "me" and "te" from quiero-basics:
- Quiero prepararme (I want to prepare myself)
- No quiero obligarte (I don't want to oblige you)

### Direct Object Pronouns
- **lo** = it (masculine) / him
- **la** = it (feminine) / her
- **los** = them (masculine)
- **las** = them (feminine)

Build through sentences:
- "I want to cancel it" → Quiero cancelarlo
- "I want to see her" → Quiero verla
- "I bought it" → Lo compré

### Indirect Object Pronouns
- **me** = to me / for me
- **te** = to you (informal)
- **le** = to him / her / you (formal)
- **nos** = to us
- **les** = to them / you guys

Key insight: "In Spanish, you can often drop 'for' — it's understood."
- "He bought it for me" → Me lo compró (not "lo compró para mí" unless emphasizing)

### Placement Rules
Two options, both correct:
1. **Attached to infinitive**: Quiero cancelarlo / Quiero hacérmelo
2. **Before conjugated verb**: Lo quiero cancelar / Me lo quiero hacer

With conjugated verbs (no infinitive), pronouns go BEFORE:
- Lo compré (I bought it) — NOT "compré lo"
- Me lo dijo (He told me it)

### Double Pronoun Order
When two pronouns combine: indirect FIRST, then direct.
- "He bought it for me" → Me (indirect) + lo (direct) = Me lo compró
- "Can you do it for me?" → ¿Me lo puedes hacer?

### Le → Se Rule
When both pronouns start with "l" (le + lo), "le" changes to "se":
- "I gave it to him" → Se lo di (NOT "le lo di")

## Common Pitfalls
- English word order ("quiero lo cancelar" — wrong)
- Forgetting that Spanish often doesn't need "for" with indirect objects
- Le + lo → "le lo" instead of "se lo"

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Builds on → quiero-basics (me/te already introduced)
- Used heavily in → reflexives
- Critical for → all sentence construction from here on
