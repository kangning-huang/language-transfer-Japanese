# Pronunciation

## What This Is
Spanish pronunciation rules — much simpler than English because Spanish is highly phonetic.

## Prerequisites
None.

## Teaching Approach

Frame it positively: "Spanish is way more phonetic than English. Once you learn these rules, you can pronounce any word correctly just by reading it."

### Vowels — The Foundation
Each vowel has exactly ONE sound, always:
- a = /ah/ (like "father")
- e = /eh/ (like "elephant")
- i = /ee/ (like "ink")
- o = /oh/ (like "open")
- u = /oo/ (like "moon")

Practice: Have the student say cognate words and focus on pronouncing each vowel as written. "Natural" — not "natchural." "Generación" — every vowel is pure.

### Consonant Notes
- **h**: completely silent. "Hospital" starts with /o/. "Ahora" = /a-o-ra/. Exception: ch = /ch/ as in English.
- **ñ**: like n + y. "Mañana" = /man-ya-na/. Only unique Spanish letter.
- **rr vs r**: single r = softer than English (but still with tongue). Double rr = rolled/trilled. "Pero" (but) vs "perro" (dog). Don't stress if you can't roll — it will come with practice.
- **b/v**: both can sound like a soft b. "Voy" might sound like /boy/. Regional variation.
- **s**: always /s/, never /z/. "Visible" = /vi-si-ble/, NOT /vi-zi-ble/.
- **qu**: always /k/. "Quiero" = /ki-e-ro/. The u is silent.
- **j**: /kh/ — throat friction. "General" = /khe-ne-ral/.
- **z/ce/ci**: /s/ in Latin America, /th/ in Spain. Student's choice.

### Stress Rules
- Words ending in vowel, n, or s: stress second-to-last syllable (ha-BLA-mos)
- Words ending in other consonants: stress last syllable (ha-BLAR)
- Written accent mark overrides: ha-BLÉ, pre-pa-ra-CIÓN

### The Key Message
"Pronounce the vowels as they're written, and you'll have a perfect accent. The rest is details."

## Common Pitfalls
- English schwa creeping in (unstressed vowels becoming "uh")
- Aspirating the silent h
- s → z between vowels (English habit)
- Stressing wrong syllable (especially with cognates — NORmal vs norMAL)

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Reinforced constantly through cognate-patterns
- Stress rules become critical for tense distinction (haBLO present vs haBLÓ past)
