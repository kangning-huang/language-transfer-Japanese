# Reflexive Verbs

## What This Is
Verbs where the action reflects back on the subject — "I prepare MYSELF," "he washes HIMSELF."

## Prerequisites
- pronouns-object

## Teaching Approach

### Start From "Quedar"
The transcript introduces reflexives through "quedar" (to remain):
- Quedar = to remain
- Quedarse = to stay (remain ONESELF)
- "Me quedo" = I stay (I remain myself)
- "Te quedas" = you stay
- "Nos quedamos" = we stay

### The Reflexive Pronouns
- me (myself), te (yourself), se (himself/herself/itself/yourself-formal)
- nos (ourselves), se (themselves/yourselves)

Same placement rules as object pronouns:
- Attached to infinitive: "Quiero quedarme" (I want to stay)
- Before conjugated verb: "Me quedo aquí" (I'm staying here)

### Common Reflexive Verbs
Daily routine (great for conversational practice):
- **Levantarse** — to get up (to raise oneself)
- **Ducharse** — to shower
- **Vestirse** — to get dressed
- **Acostarse** — to go to bed (to lay oneself down)
- **Despertarse** — to wake up

Emotional/state changes:
- **Enamorarse** — to fall in love (to enamor oneself)
- **Enojarse** — to get angry
- **Preocuparse** — to worry
- **Irse** — to leave (reflexive of ir adds "leaving" emphasis)

### Verbs That Change Meaning with Reflexive
- Ir = to go → Irse = to leave
- Dormir = to sleep → Dormirse = to fall asleep
- Poner = to put → Ponerse = to put on (clothes) / to become
- Quedar = to remain → Quedarse = to stay

### Key Teaching Point
"Many reflexive verbs in Spanish aren't reflexive in English. You 'prepare yourself' instead of 'getting ready.' You 'remain yourself' instead of 'staying.' The Spanish is more literal about who the action affects."

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting the reflexive pronoun ("quedo" without "me" doesn't mean "stay")
- Wrong pronoun for the subject ("me quedas" — mixing I-pronoun with you-verb)
- Pronoun placement with compound structures: "debemos quedarnos" not "debemos nos quedar"

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Builds on → pronouns-object (same placement rules)
- Important for → daily routine conversations
