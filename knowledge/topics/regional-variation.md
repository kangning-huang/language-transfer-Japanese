# Regional Variation

## What This Is
How Spanish differs across regions — vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, and cultural norms.

## Prerequisites
- register-formality

## Teaching Approach

### The Big Picture
"There is no single 'correct' Spanish. There are 20+ countries and 500+ million speakers. What matters is being understood and understanding others."

### Pronunciation Variation
| Feature | Where | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Seseo (z/ce/ci = /s/) | All of Latin America, southern Spain | "Cerveza" = /servesa/ |
| Distinción (z/ce/ci = /θ/) | Most of Spain | "Cerveza" = /thervetha/ |
| Yeísmo (ll = y) | Most of Spanish-speaking world | "Lluvia" = /yuvia/ |
| Sheísmo (ll/y = /sh/) | Argentina, Uruguay | "Lluvia" = /shuvia/ |
| Aspirated s | Caribbean, Andalusia | "Estás" = /ehtáh/ |
| Dropped final consonants | Caribbean | "Verdad" = /verdá/ |

### Grammar Variation
- **Voseo** (vos instead of tú): Argentina, Uruguay, Central America, parts of Colombia
  - Vos hablás, vos tenés, vos venís (stress on last syllable)
- **Ustedes for everything** (no vosotros): All of Latin America
- **Leísmo** (le instead of lo for masculine direct object): Central Spain
  - "Le vi" instead of "Lo vi" (I saw him) — accepted in Spain, not in Latin America
- **Past tense preference**: Spain loves present perfect for recent past ("Hoy he comido"); Latin America prefers preterite ("Hoy comí")

### Vocabulary Differences
Some words change meaning entirely across regions:

| Concept | Spain | Mexico | Argentina | Colombia |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Car | Coche | Carro | Auto | Carro |
| Computer | Ordenador | Computadora | Computadora | Computador |
| Bus | Autobús | Camión | Colectivo | Bus |
| Cell phone | Móvil | Celular | Celular | Celular |
| Cool/awesome | Mola | Padre/Chido | Copado | Bacano/Chévere |
| Apartment | Piso | Departamento | Departamento | Apartamento |
| To drive | Conducir | Manejar | Manejar | Manejar |
| Money (slang) | Pasta | Lana | Guita | Plata |

### False Friends Across Dialects
- **Coger**: to take/grab (Spain) vs. vulgar term (Latin America — use "tomar" or "agarrar")
- **Concha**: seashell (Spain) vs. vulgar term (Argentina — careful)
- **Torta**: cake (Spain) vs. sandwich (Mexico) vs. slap (some regions)

### Key Teaching Point
"Don't pick a 'team.' Understand the differences so you can talk to anyone. Your own Spanish will naturally reflect whoever you practice with most — and that's perfect."

### Practical Advice
1. Pick ONE accent/region to focus on for production (whichever you most engage with)
2. Expose yourself to ALL major variants for comprehension
3. When in a specific country, adapt (use their vocabulary, mirror their register)
4. When writing, standard neutral Spanish works everywhere

## Common Pitfalls
- Thinking one variety is "more correct" (it's not)
- Using "coger" in Latin America without awareness
- Mixing voseo conjugations with tuteo (pick one system)
- Dismissing voseo/Caribbean Spanish as "incorrect"

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Voseo is a practical extension of → register-formality
- Pronunciation differences affect listening comprehension at all levels
