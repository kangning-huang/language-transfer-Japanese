# Register and Formality

## What This Is
Navigating tú/usted/vos, formal vs informal writing, and softening requests. The social layer of Spanish.

## Prerequisites
- subjunctive-present

## Teaching Approach

### The Three "You" Systems
- **Tú** = informal singular (most of Spain, Mexico, most of Latin America)
- **Usted** = formal singular (everywhere)
- **Vos** = informal singular (Argentina, Uruguay, Central America — replaces tú)
- **Vosotros** = informal plural (Spain only)
- **Ustedes** = formal/informal plural (all of Latin America; formal only in Spain)

### Voseo — Not a Curiosity, a Reality
110+ million Spanish speakers use "vos." Conjugation differs:
- Tú hablas → Vos hablás
- Tú tienes → Vos tenés
- Tú vienes → Vos venís
- "If you watch Argentine shows or have Argentine friends, you need this."

### When to Use Usted
- With strangers who are older
- In professional settings (doctor, lawyer, business)
- When someone uses it with you (mirror their choice)
- In formal writing
- Default when unsure: "Start formal, let them informalize. Never the reverse."

### Softening Requests (Politeness Strategies)
From most direct to most polite:
1. "Quiero un café" (I want a coffee — direct, potentially rude)
2. "¿Me pone un café?" (Can you get me a coffee — standard)
3. "¿Podría ponerme un café?" (Could you get me a coffee — polite)
4. "Querría un café, por favor" (I would like a coffee — very polite)
5. "¿Le importaría...?" (Would you mind...? — most polite)

Conditional and imperfect subjunctive add politeness naturally.

### Written Register
- Informal: no accent marks ignored, abbreviations (q for que, tmb for también)
- Standard: correct grammar, normal punctuation
- Formal: usted, longer sentences, passive voice, subjunctive preferred over indicative alternatives
- Literary: inverted word order, aesthetic choices, archaic forms

### Key Teaching Point
"Register isn't about being correct — it's about being appropriate. A perfectly grammatical sentence in the wrong register can be more damaging than a grammatical error in the right one."

## Common Pitfalls
- Using tú with someone who expects usted (can feel disrespectful)
- Over-formalizing with friends (sounds cold/distant)
- Not recognizing voseo in media (thinking it's "wrong" Spanish)
- Translating English politeness markers directly ("siento molestarte" vs. "¿te importa si...?")

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Politeness uses → future-conditional (querría, podría)
- Formal register uses → subjunctive more heavily
- Regional awareness connects to → regional-variation
