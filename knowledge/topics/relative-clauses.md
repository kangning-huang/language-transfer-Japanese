# Relative Clauses

## What This Is
Connecting sentences with "that," "who," "where," "which" — and when they require subjunctive.

## Prerequisites
- subjunctive-present

## Teaching Approach

### Core Relative Pronouns
- **Que** = that / which / who (most common — covers almost everything)
- **Quien** = who (used after prepositions: "con quien," "para quien")
- **Donde** = where ("la ciudad donde vivo")
- **Lo que** = what / that which ("lo que quiero" = what I want)
- **El/La que** = the one that ("el que habla" = the one who speaks)
- **Cuyo/a** = whose (formal/literary: "el hombre cuyo hijo...")

### The Indicative vs. Subjunctive Distinction
This is the subtle part:

**Indicative** = the thing EXISTS, you know it's real
- "Busco al hombre que **habla** inglés" (I'm looking for the man who speaks English — I know which man)

**Subjunctive** = the thing MAY NOT EXIST, you're describing a hypothetical
- "Busco a alguien que **hable** inglés" (I'm looking for someone who speaks English — anyone, I don't have a specific person)

### More Contrasts
- "Tengo un amigo que **sabe** cocinar" (I have a friend who knows how to cook — real, existing friend)
- "Necesito un amigo que **sepa** cocinar" (I need a friend who can cook — hypothetical, don't have one yet)

### Key Teaching Point
"Ask yourself: am I talking about something REAL and SPECIFIC, or something I'm LOOKING FOR or IMAGINING? Real = indicative. Hypothetical = subjunctive."

## Common Pitfalls
- Overusing "cual" (common in textbooks, less common in speech — "que" does most work)
- Missing the indicative/subjunctive distinction in relative clauses
- Using "quien" for things (only for people — use "que" for things)

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Subjunctive usage here mirrors → subjunctive-triggers (same underlying real vs unreal logic)
- Lo que connects to → stylistic-nuance (lo + adjective constructions)
