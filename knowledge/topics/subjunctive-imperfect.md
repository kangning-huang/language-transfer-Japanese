# Imperfect Subjunctive

## What This Is
Past subjunctive — for wishes about the past, hypotheticals, polite requests, and "como si" (as if).

## Prerequisites
- subjunctive-present
- past-imperfect

## Teaching Approach

### Formation — From Preterite "Ellos" Form
Beautiful shortcut: take the ellos preterite, drop -ron, add -ra endings:
- Hablaron → habla- → hablara, hablaras, hablara, habláramos, hablaran
- Comieron → comie- → comiera, comieras, comiera, comiéramos, comieran
- Dijeron → dije- → dijera, dijeras, dijera, dijéramos, dijeran

"Any verb. Including all the messy preterite irregulars. The -ra form inherits them perfectly."

### The -se Alternative
There's an alternate form (-se instead of -ra): hablase, comiese, dijese
- Both mean the same thing
- -ra is more common in speech
- -se is more common in formal writing and literature
- "Know both exist, use -ra"

### When to Use It

**1. Si-clauses (hypotheticals)**
- "Si tuviera dinero, viajaría." (If I had money, I would travel.)
- NEVER use conditional after si. ALWAYS past subjunctive.

**2. Past wishes**
- "Ojalá estuviera aquí." (I wish he were here.)
- "Quisiera un café." (I would like a coffee — very polite)

**3. Como si (as if)**
- "Habla como si fuera español." (He speaks as if he were Spanish.)
- Always subjunctive after "como si"

**4. Past sequence of subjunctive triggers**
- Present: "Quiero que vengas" (I want you to come)
- Past: "Quería que vinieras" (I wanted you to come)
- The main verb in the past pulls the subjunctive into the past too.

### The Etymology Easter Egg
"The -ra form actually comes from the Latin pluperfect indicative. 'Hablara' literally used to mean 'had spoken.' Over centuries it became subjunctive. You're speaking Living Latin."

## Common Pitfalls
- Using conditional after si ("si tendría" — NEVER)
- Confusing -ra form with -ría conditional (hablara vs hablaría)
- Forgetting the -se alternative exists (reading comprehension)

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Essential for → conditional-subjunctive (full hypothetical chains)
- Past version of → subjunctive-triggers
