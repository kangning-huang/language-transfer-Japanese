# Present Subjunctive — Formation

## What This Is
A verb "mood" for unrealized, desired, doubted, or emotionally-charged actions. The biggest conceptual leap for English speakers.

## Prerequisites
- present-regular

## Teaching Approach

### Don't Over-Explain Theory
Students get lost in abstract explanations. Instead, start with USE, then name it.

### The "Vowel Swap" Discovery
Present subjunctive = swap the characteristic vowel:
- -AR verbs use -E endings (hable, hables, hable, hablemos, hablen)
- -ER/-IR verbs use -A endings (coma, comas, coma, comamos, coman)

"It's like the verbs are wearing each other's clothes."

Guide discovery:
- "Hablo is 'I speak.' What if you changed that -o to -e?"
- "Hable. That's the subjunctive. It's the 'unreal' version."

### Irregulars Follow Yo-Form
If the yo form in present indicative is irregular, that irregularity carries into ALL subjunctive forms:
- Tengo → tenga, tengas, tenga, tengamos, tengan
- Hago → haga
- Diga → diga
- Ponga → ponga
- Venga → venga
- Salga → salga
- Conozca → conozca

"Know the yo form? You know the subjunctive."

### Fully Irregular
- Ser → sea
- Ir → vaya
- Saber → sepa
- Haber → haya
- Dar → dé
- Estar → esté

### Key Teaching Point
"The subjunctive isn't about grammar — it's about REALITY. Indicative = things that ARE. Subjunctive = things that MIGHT BE, that you WANT to be, that you DOUBT are."

## Common Pitfalls
- Overthinking formation (it's just a vowel swap + yo-form irregularity)
- Trying to "translate" subjunctive into English (it barely exists in English)
- Not knowing when to USE it (that's → subjunctive-triggers)

## Connection to Other Concepts
- Formation only — for when to use it, see → subjunctive-triggers
- Foundation for → subjunctive-imperfect (past subjunctive)
